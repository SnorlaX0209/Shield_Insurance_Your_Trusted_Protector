## Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing Shield Insurance's operational data to provide actionable insights that will support data-driven decision-making. By utilizing Microsoft Power BI, we aim to create an interactive dashboard that enables a comprehensive view of key metrics, such as customer count, revenue generation, growth rates, and customer segmentation. The dashboard will also allow us to track trends, identify areas for improvement, and optimize the company's performance.

## Problem Statement:
Shield Insurance faces challenges in monitoring critical business metrics such as customer growth, revenue generation, and policy trends. With a growing customer base and a variety of sales modes, it is essential to have a clear understanding of these key drivers to facilitate effective decision-making. The lack of an integrated, interactive dashboard has made it difficult to track real-time data, identify trends, and gain insights for strategic business decisions.

## Project Goal:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust, interactive dashboard that provides deep insights into the operational performance of Shield Insurance. This will include tracking the number of customers, total revenue, growth rates, policy trends, and customer segmentation by age and city. By creating dynamic visualizations and enabling easy filtering options, the project aims to enhance the ability to monitor business progress, identify trends, and ultimately support data-driven decision-making to drive growth and improve performance.
